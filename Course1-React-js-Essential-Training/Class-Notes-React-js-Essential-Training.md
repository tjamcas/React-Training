# Course 1: React.js Essential Training
## Class Notes

### Section 1: what is React

- To add React Developer Tools extension to Chrome:
    - <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en>
- To add React Developer Tools extension to FIrefox:
    - <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/>
- React learning (docs and tutorials) resource:
    - <https://reactjs.org/>
- Shortcut to open React Developer Tools in Chrome:
    - Mac: `Command+Option+J`
- Installing Node and NPM on your Mac:
    - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
    - node is a framework that can run JavaScript code on your machine while npm is a package manager. Using npm we can install and remove javascript packages also known as node modules.
    - go to <https://nodejs.org/en/> for latest version download


### Section 2: Intro to React Elements
- To create and run a package on your computer, run the following in Terminal:
    - `npx create-react-app appName`
    - `npx` is the package runner
    - `create-react-app` is the tool to create and build the project
- Once the package is built, you can:
    - `cd appname` to go to the directory where you created the package named `appName`
    - `npm start` to run the package
        - this will open `localhost:3000` in the Chrome browser
        - this is just a local web server in your browser that runs the package files
- Alternatively, you can run the package in `React-CodeSandbox`:
    - enter `react.new` in the Chrome browser
    - Your browser will go to the site: <https://codesandbox.io/s/new?utm_source=dotnew> where you can experiment with new code
- `create-react-app` builds the following file structure:
    - `appName`
        - `package.json`
            -  `"dependencies"` provides details of React version, testing libraries, and `react-scripts`
            -  `react-scripts` sets up the tooling
        -  `appName/src`
            -  contains all the code files that we write for an app
        -  `appName/public`
            -  contains assets like an index.html and logos files that will be used to build the app
-  Creating React elements
    -  `index.js`:    
        ```
        import React from "react";
        import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
        import "./index.css";

        ReactDOM.render(
          React.createElement(
            "h1",
            { style: { color: "blue" } },
            "Heyyy Everyone!"
          ),
          document.getElementById("root")
        );
        ```
    - the `ReactDOM.render(arg1, arg2)` function has two arguments:
        - `arg1`is the element that you want create using `React.createElement(argA, argB, argC)`
        - `arg2` specifies the location where you want to insert the new element using `document.getElementById(argD)`
    - `React.createElement(argA, argB, argC)`
        - `argA` is the type of HTML element/tag that you want to add
        - `argB` contains properties for the HTML element -- if none then specify `null`
        - `argC` is the element value -- in this case, the text for the `h1` header
    - `document.getElementById(argD)`
        - `argD` specifies where you want to insert the newly created element -- in this case the newly created `h1` header is to be inserted into an element with an id of "root"
    - _Note:_ in this example code snippet we have removed `React.StrictMode` which generates warnings if any code is outside of a coding best practice.
- Refactoring elements using JSX
    - JSX - Javascript as XML - is a javaScript language extension that allows you to write HTML tags directly in JavaScript
    - For example:
    ```
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    import "./index.css";

    ReactDOM.render(
      <ul>
        <li>Monday</li>
        <li>Tuesday</li>
        <li>Wednesday</li>
      </ul>,
      document.getElementById("root")
    );
    ```    
    - JSX is the code between and including the `<ul>` and `</ul>` start and end tags.
    - When you use `create-react-app`, the Babel compiler is used to correctly interpret JSX code that it finds embedded in the JavaScript code.
    - For more information on the Babel JavaScript compiler, go to: <https://babeljs.io/>
